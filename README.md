# REST API Training Assignments

This repository contains multiple Java Maven projects in the subfolders,
that are used as assignments for the REST API Training. 

Load each of the Maven projects in your ID and make sure it compiles (Java 21 is required).
Then check README.md in each of the assignments' projects (folders) for the details on how 
to implement assignments.
